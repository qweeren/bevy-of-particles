# Falling Sand Simulator

A physics-based particle simulation built with Rust and the Bevy game engine. This project implements a falling sand game where different materials interact with each other based on their physical properties like density.

## Features

- Multiple materials with unique behaviors:
  - Sand: Falls and piles up realistically
  - Water: Flows and interacts with other materials
  - Smoke: Rises and dissipates
  - Concrete: Static building material
- Real-time particle simulation
- Density-based material interactions
- Customizable brush size for drawing
- User-friendly sidebar interface

## Technical Details

- Built with Rust ðŸ¦€
- Uses Bevy game engine (v0.15.2) for rendering and game systems
- Efficient grid-based simulation
- Custom material behavior system
- Multi-threaded updates using Rayon

## Controls

- Left-click and drag to place materials
- Select materials from the sidebar
- Adjust brush size using the slider

## Building and Running

1. Ensure you have Rust installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run with cargo:
```bash
cargo run --release
```
